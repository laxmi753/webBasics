    <h2>Welcome to Day3</h2>
    <p>Here We discuss about the bootstrap and it's uses:</p>
    <h2>What is bootstrap?</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework used for developing responsive and visually appealing websites.
     It provides pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, such as navigation bars, buttons, modals, grids, 
     and more, to help developers build user-friendly interfaces quickly and efficiently.</p>
     <h2>Why Bootstrap was introduced?</h2>
     <p>Bootstrap was introduced to simplify and speed up the process of developing responsive, mobile-first websites.
     It originated at Twitter in 2010, created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton, to address inconsistencies in web development 
     across teams. The framework was officially released as an open-source project in 2011.</p>
   <h5>Hereâ€™s why Bootstrap was introduced:</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>Consistency: To make websites look the same, even when different developers work on them.</li>
    <li>Responsive Design: To create websites that work well on phones, tablets, and computers.</li>
    <li>Save Time: To provide ready-made components (like buttons and menus) so developers can work faster.</li>
    <li>Browser Compatibility: To ensure websites work smoothly on different web browsers.</li>
    <li>Community Support: To encourage collaboration and keep improving with feedback from developers worldwide.</li>
   

   <p>If you want to use Bootstrap in your HTML file.</p>
   <li>First you have add Bootstrap to your project by linking it's CDN in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML:</li>
   <img src="">
   <li>Then,you can use it by using their pre-built components.</li>
   </ul>
