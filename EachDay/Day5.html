    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language used primarily for building interactive and dynamic websites.
        It allows developers to add functionality to web pages, such as animations, form validations, dynamic content
        updates,
        and much more.</p>
    <h2>Why JavaScript is introduced?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich to make websites more interactive and engaging.
        At the time, web pages were mostly static, meaning they could only display content without allowing users
        to interact with them beyond clicking links.Here's why JavaScript was introduced:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> To allow web pages to change in real time, like showing updated information without refreshing the page.
        </li>
        <li> To enable features like forms that validate user input, dropdown menus, and animated elements.</li>
        <li> To run directly in the browser, so users wouldn't need to install additional software.</li>
        <li> To make it simpler for developers to add interactive features with less coding effort.</li>
    </ul>
